# DNC-SemesterProject
# Semester Project: exploring Differentiable Neural Computers and applications
*Authors: Marco Angius and Giorgio Avalle*

The goals of the project are: 
- [x] explore the architecture of DNCs
- [x] define a base code for running simulations
- <del>possible create a pytorch version of the code</del>
- [x] try to implement the graph tasks
- [x] map the graph task to an application   


The project is based on the article of [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/blog/differentiable-neural-computers/) and 
the code available [here](https://github.com/deepmind/dnc).

### Running Notes
For the *networkx* library use the 1.8.1 version.
