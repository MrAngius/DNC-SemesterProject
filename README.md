# DNC-SemesterProject
# Semester Project: exploring Differentiable Neural Computers and applications
*Authors: Marco Angius and Giorgio Avalle*

The goals of the project are: 
- [x] explore the architecture of DNCs
- [ ] define a base code for running simulations
- [ ] possible create a pytorch version of the code
- [ ] try to implement the graph task 
- [ ] map the graph task to an application   

The project is based on the article of [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/blog/differentiable-neural-computers/) and 
the code available [here](https://github.com/deepmind/dnc).
