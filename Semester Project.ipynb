    "## Introduction\n",
    "What we want to present in the following notebook is a cutting-edge topic in machine learning, related to a particular model of Neural Network called **Differentable Neural Computer** (DNC) which puts together a Neural Network and an external memory from which the Netwoek can read and write. The main source of this noteboook is based on the article and paper which can be found [here](https://deepmind.com/blog/differentiable-neural-computers/).\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with a presentation of the DNC and how they are enhanced form *Neural Turing Machines*. Then we move to the core topic of this networks which are the three **differentiable attention mechanisms** with whihc the network performs the read and writes operations. We propose then a code for the implementation of these Networks, testing their performances and limitations. Finally we will try to implement the graph task presented in the paper and adapt it to a different problem.\n",

    "## DNC\n",
    "The Differentiable Neural Computers are neural networks with a coupled memory, where the dimension of this memory does not affect the behaviour of the network. The memory can be tought as a RAM and the Network as a controller which is differentiable using gradient descent-like tecniques.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Comparing this Network with the respect of other whihc present memory states such as RNN or LSTM, DNCs do not store information whihc is tigth coupled with the model itself. Instead, they have the possibility to selectively read and write to and from memory locations, creating a separation between state preservation and content (data).\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the litterature, another network capable of read and write using an external memory came out in the past, called **Neural Turing Machine** (NTM). Altought the concept is similar to the DNC, with a Network acting as controller and an external memory, they are more restricted in the method with which the Neural Network access the memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "![DNC](./figures/DNC_architecture.png)\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The image shows the architecture of a DNC Neural Network. In this specif example, the controller is a Recursive Neural Network (a LSTM is also possible) which is receiving an input (from a dataset) and the previous step readings from the memory. The output of the network is made of two parts:\n",
    "- The output of the Neural Network, which constitute our target\n",
    "- A vector called **'Interface Vector'** which is used by the read and write heads to interact with the memory\n",
    "\n",
    "As it's clear by now, the DNC is mainly composed of two parts interacting together: the **Neural Netwoerk** itself (**a**) and the **Heads** (**b**) which performs the operations over the **Memory** (**c**). Those oprations are the key differences of DNC over NTM and will be described in details in the next paragraph. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Heads are particular components which are dealing with the content of the memory. It's possible to define as many read and write heads as needed, all of them will receive weights vector which are used to define the location over which perform the read and write operations. The differentiability of these parts allows the network to learn how to perform these operations simple by looking at the error during the trainign process and adjusting the weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in addition to the Memory there is an additional information whcih is saved and used during the read and writes operations. Those are the **Memory Usage and Temporal Links** (**d**) which is an imprvement over the NTM. Those links and usage information allows to dynamically allocate the content during the reads and to have notion of temporal assosciation between entries of the memory. That is, it's possibile to know the sequence of the writtings which is extremely important when the Network has to deal to sequential tasks such as graph path search.\n",

    "## Memory Interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "The core mechanism of DNCs is the possibility to write and read from an external memory matrix. As mentioned, the difference with the NTMs is in defining more **attention mechanisms**. This is different from the address mechanisms in conventional computers, where there is a mapping between the address and the content of the memory. The idea here is to define the weights over the location of the Memory. Those weights represents a degree (we can immagine it has a filter) that indicates how much the locations in the Memory matrix are involved during read and writing operations.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Briefly:\n",
    "- a read vector $\\mathbf{r}$ is returned after a read operation which involves a read weights matrix $\\mathbf{w^r}$:<br>\n",
    "    $\\mathbf{r}=\\sum_{i=1}^N M[i,j]w^r[i]$ for $j=1, \\dots,W$\n",
    "    \n",
    "- an erase vector $\\mathbf{e}$ is applied using the write weights matrix $\\mathbf{w^w}$, then a a write vector is added $\\mathbf{v}$:<br>\n",
    "    $\\mathbf{v}: M[i,j] \\leftarrow M[i,j](1-\\mathbf{w^w}[i]\\mathbf{e}[j]+\\mathbf{w^w}[i]\\mathbf{v}[j])$\n",
    "\n",
    "The units which determines this operations are the read and write Heads. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Differentiable Attention\n",
    "There are three forms of differentiable attention. This is more a fancy terminology to call the three pricipal techniques involved in in order to address the memory. Before going into the details we want to recall some of the techniques which are instead used in NTM to appreasciate the difference with the DNC. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two mechanism for addressing the memory and the Neural Tuning Machines combines both:\n",
    "- *content-based addressing*: focuses attention on locations based on the similarity between their current values and values emitted by the controller. This is related to the content addressing of the Hopfield networks, the controller needs to generate a value which is an approximation of the one stored to then retrieve the exact location. \n",
    "- *location-based addressing*: it's the traditional approach to address the memory. For arithmetic operation where we need to define variables the conent based in not enough, we need the location of the variable to perform the operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differentiable Neural Computers uses a *content-based addressing* paired with other two techniques which allows for a **Dynamic Memory Addressing** counteracting the major drawbacks of the NTM:\n",
    "1. NTMs do not avoid possible overlapping and interfere among blocks of allocating memory. DNCs instead overcame this problem due to there is only a single free at each write time.\n",
    "2. NTMs does not allow for freeing location of memory which are not used and this can be a problem when processing long sequences. DNCs instead can free memory locations based on the usage weights.\n",
    "3. NTMs sequential information is preserved only if the content is written in consecutive locations. DNCs uses an additional temporal link matrix avoidin the restriction to continuous locations only. \n",
    "\n",
    "For now we explain the concepts of these three differentiable attention. A more detailed analysis will be given in the following paragraphs\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Content base addressing\n",
    "This form is used to determine the similarity measure between the vector emmited by the controller and the content of the memory. The measure is a cosine similarity function that returns weights which are then used by the read head for associative recall or by the write head to modify the conetent of the memory. In addition, if the key only match a part of the conentent of the memory this is still useful and can lead to the retrieval of that location. This may be due to the key may not have all the information which instead are stored in the memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Temporary links\n",
    "This form keep track of the transitions betweens locations which were consecutively written using an $LxL$ temporal *link matrix* $L$. This matrix associate a weight from 0 to 1 for each pair of locations in the matrix, where the entry $L[i,j]$ is the temporal relation between the location $i$ and $j$. The weight is closer to $1$ if the locations $i$ was written after $j$, otherwise the value is closer to $0$. This gives to the Neural Network the ability to recover sequences following the order under which they were written.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The product $L\\mathbf{w}$ creat a smoothing effect, shifting the focus forwards the locations after those emphasized by $\\mathbf{w}$. That is, after a writting which is based on $\\mathbf{w}$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Usage \n",
    "This form is used to allocate the memory for writting. The usage is a value between $0$ and $1$, with a weighting to select unsued locations that is delivered to the writing head. The usage is incremented after each write to that location and decreased after each read. The good property is that this is independent from the memory size and content. This allows the network to be trained and then upgrade to a larger one."

    "## Implementation\n",
    "The code has been taken from [github](https://github.com/deepmind/dnc). The idea is to analyse it and further modify or add some parts of the implementation in order to achieve our goals. For now we just list the major modules which are used to implement the DNC. Then we will used the *Repeat Copy Task* to perfrom some tests on the DNC. The final goal from the implementation point of view is to extend this one with the *Graph Task*\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The modules provided are the following:\n",
    "- **Addressing and Access  Modules**\n",
    "    The following code implements the addressing methods discussed above. In addition another script provides the function necessary to manipulate the memory exploiting the addressing methods already defined.\n",
    "- **DNC Module**\n",
    "    The following code represents the core of the Differentiable Neural Computer. This is an extention of the class RNN core, which include also the manipulation with the memory. We have to reming that the Controller is implemented as LSTM reccurent network.\n",
    "- **Repeat Copy Task**\n",
    "    The folowing code is used to create a dataset for the copy task. The DNC receives in input batches of collections of string which have to be copied a number of times which is defined randomly.\n",
    "- **Training Module** \n",
    "    Finally the code for the trainig is porvided. This code allows also to save the variables of the model for checkpoint it and restore the values for an input evaluation. Note that the variables are saved and not the model, this mean that it's needed to reacreate the graph then loead the variables during a session.\n",

    "## Tests\n",
    "To performs some test on the model we had to modify the way the dataset was originted. The first test is to understand how much the model is sensitive to noised data. We have taken the original generation code and applied some modifications. For random betchs (where the randomness is further explained) we flipped the values of the bit in the string to copy alterning the target. That is, to deceive the DNC to perform it's original task of copying a string of bits several times we have changed the target. So we let the DNC assume it made it wrong and underdtand if for some samples this may cause a non convergence of the error to 0.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Before analysizing the noised version we have to test the DNC in a normal copy task with non altered target values. We can exploit the modified code in order to create the training environment over which manipulate the DNC training which allows for both non noised and noised training."

For future test it's possible to directly override the train method and keep the interface with the DNC consistent. That is, it's only needed to add to the Tensorflow Graph operations which allows the training such as the computation of the loss and then run the session."

    "## Graph Task\n",
    "Now we propose an implementation for the **Graph Tasks** as described in the paper. \n",
    "Before proceding with the code we provided some implementation design choices for the tasks.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graph Task Description\n",
    "The idea is to perform the following tasks on a graph:\n",
    "- Traversal \n",
    "- Shortest Path\n",
    "- Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "All tasks need a random generation of graph triples consisting of a *source label*, *edge label*, *destination label*. To achieve so, we first generate a random graph by sampling the unit square *N* nodes. Then, *N* numbers are drawn uniformly between $0$ and $999$ and assign randomly to the nodes. This makes the node labels to be unique across the nodes of the network. To decide the neighbors of each node, the KNN (K-nearest neighbour) is used. Once selected the possible neihbours, edges are created between the nodes. Each edge for the neigbourhood is given a label which is a random number among the $N$ already selected for the nodes. For the **Traversal** and the **Shortest Path**, the *edge label* is unique in the neighborhood but not unique in the graph. This means that the DNC has to infer the possible unique relation between two given nodes and their relative edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Encoding\n",
    "In order to provide those labels to the DNC controller, the triples are encode using a **10-way one-hot encoding**. That is, each digit has been encoded using a $10$ bit vector with all zeros except the position which identifies the digit set to $1$. This is done for all the $9$ digit representing a triple creating a **90 bit** vector. There is a **special reserved character** (\\_) which indicates that there is no input for the given label, this is represented with the zero vector with the same lengts as if there were a digit.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Phases\n",
    "For the training, the DNC controller receives sequences, each one representing a triple. The seuqences are divided into four phases:\n",
    "1. **Descritpion Phase**: used to present to the NN the triples of the graph over which perform the tasks.\n",
    "2. **Query Phase**: used to present queries to the NN based on the proposed graph.\n",
    "3. **Planning Phase**: no input are provided here, the phase is used to allow the DNC controller to prepare the answers.\n",
    "4. **Answer Phase**: a part for the *Shortest Path Task*, no input is presented here. During this phase the DNC outputs the answers for the given queries. In this fase, and only here, also the targets are used to compute the loss and train the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to distinguish the different phases and indicates a transition, there are two additional bits, called channels, included in the input. The design choice is to let the bit of the first channel to be 1 only when there is a trainsition between the phases, and the bit of the second channel is only set to $1$ during all the **Answer Phase**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output and Loss\n",
    "The output of the DNC controller are 90 bits, representing nine softmax distribution over the 10 bits. The loss for given sequences is computed as the sum of the log-probabilities of correctly predicting the bits for the nine digits.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "*Here we have to comment about a possibile error in the paper where the sum is computed from 0 to 9. We have to argue due to this in not complient with what is written before the formula.*\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Given input sequences $\\mathbf{x}$ and target $\\mathbf{z}$, the loss is computed as follow:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "    $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{z})=\\sum_{t=1}^T \\{ A(t) \\sum_{d=0}^8 log[Pr(\\mathbf{z_{t}^d}|\\mathbf{y_{t}^d}) ] \\} $\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{z_{t}^d}$ is the target for the sequence $t$ and for the digit $d$, $\\mathbf{y_{t}^d}$ is the output fo the DNC controller for the sequence $t$ and for the digit $d$, $A(t)$ is a binary value whcih indicates when the loss has to be consider valid for the trainign. That is, ths value is $1$ during the **Answer Phase** and $0$ in the other ones. For the implementation we have created a mask for simulating this scenario, the mask entry is set to 1 for those seuqences for whcih the training is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Network Prediction** is determined as the mode of the output of the single softmax distribution over the 10 bits for each of the nine digits. When the network has finished to output an answer, a special output pattern is given as idicated in the paper. Our choise, as non further detail are provided in the paper, is to output all (\\_) characters which means a $90$ bit zero vector as termination pattern. The DNC has been trained also on this special output. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, as a performance metric, the total right predictions over all possibile ones is given."

    "### Traversal Task\n",
    "The first task we implement is the Traversal one. This is based on random walks generated from a random Graph. As we described before, during the **Description Phase** the graph triples are presented to the NN, then a series of Queries and Answer tripels. During the **Query Phase**, the first triple is made of the *source node* and *the edge* label (source label, edge label, \\_) with the destination missing. The further triples contains only the *edge label* (\\_, edge label, \\_). The DNC has to save the save the triples of the graph and infer the right nodes which from a source node connects all the nodes of the random walks. We reming that the *edge labels* are not unique accross the graph. That is, the network has to remember the previous destination node of a triple and use it as source label for the following triple."

For each dataset, the observation (comprasing sequences for all the phases of the task) and targets are given.
