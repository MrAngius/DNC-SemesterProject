    "## Introduction\n",
    "What we want to present in the following notebook is a cutting-edge topic in machine learning, related to a particular model of Neural Network called **Differentable Neural Computer** (DNC) which puts together a Neural Network and an external memory from which the Network can read and write. The main source of this noteboook is based on the article and paper which can be found [here](https://deepmind.com/blog/differentiable-neural-computers/).\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with a presentation and a comparison of the DNC and its anchestor, the *Neural Turing Machine*. Then, we will move to the core topic of this kind of networks: the **differentiable attention mechanism**, necessary to perform memory read and write operations. Finally, the implementation code for these Networks will be proposed, while testing and discussing their performances and limitations: also, we will try to implement the graph task presented in the paper adapting it to a different problem."

    "## DNC\n",
    "### In a nutshell\n",
    "The Differentiable Neural Computers are **neural networks with a coupled memory**, whose size does not affect the behaviour of the network. This memory can be tought as a RAM module, while the Network can be seen as a controller (fully differentiable using gradient descent-like tecniques).\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing this Network with respect to others who present memory states, such as RNN or LSTM, DNCs do not store information coupled with the model itself. Instead, they have the possibility to selectively read from and write to memory locations, creating a separation between state preservation and content (data).\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison with NTMs\n",
    "In the past litterature, it is possible to find another network capable of operating with an external memory: the so called **Neural Turing Machine** (NTM). Altought the underlying concept is similar to the DNC, they can be seen as the DNCs anchestor because they have more restricted methods to access the external memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture\n",
    "In this specific example, the controller is a Recursive Neural Network (an LSTM would have been also possible) that receives both the current input (from a dataset) and the previous step readings from the memory. The output of the network is made of two parts:\n",
    "- The output of the Neural Network, which constitute our target\n",
    "- A vector called **'Interface Vector'** which is used by the read and write heads to interact with the memory\n",
    "\n",
    "![DNC](./figures/DNC_architecture.png)\n",
    "<center><i>The DNC architecture<i></center>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "As it's clear by now, the DNC is mainly composed of two parts interacting together: the **Neural Network** itself (**a**) and the **Heads** (**b**) which performs the operations over the **Memory** (**c**). Those oprations are the key differences of DNC over NTM and will be described in details in the next paragraph. \n",
    "\n",
    "The *Heads* are particular components whose role is to deal with the content of the memory. It's possible to define as many read and write heads as needed: all of them will receive *weights vectors*, used to define the location over which perform the read and write operations. The differentiability of these parts allows the network to be trained using algorithms like the Gradient Descent, learning how to perform these operations simply by looking at the error during the training process and adjusting the weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in addition to the Memory there are some additional information saved and used during the read and write operations: the **Memory Usage and Temporal Links** (**d**), another improvement over the NTM. Those links and usage information allows to dynamically allocate the content during the reads and to have notion of temporal associations between memory's entries. In other words, it's possibile to know the sequence of the writings: this becomes extremely important when the Network has to deal with sequential tasks, such as the graph path search."

    "## Memory Interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "The core mechanism of DNCs is the possibility to write and read from an external memory matrix. As already mentioned, the difference with the NTMs is in defining more **attention mechanisms**. This is different from the address mechanisms used in conventional computers, where there is a mapping between the address and the content of the memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea here is to define weights over the location of the Memory, representing a degree (we can immagine it has a filter) to indicate how much every memory location is involved during read and writing operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly:\n",
    "- a read vector $\\mathbf{r}$ is returned after a read operation which involves a read weights matrix $\\mathbf{w^r}$:<br>\n",
    "    $\\mathbf{r}=\\sum_{i=1}^N M[i,j]w^r[i]$ for $j=1, \\dots,W$\n",
    "    \n",
    "- an erase vector $\\mathbf{e}$ is applied using the write weights matrix $\\mathbf{w^w}$, then a a write vector is added $\\mathbf{v}$:<br>\n",
    "    $\\mathbf{v}: M[i,j] \\leftarrow M[i,j](1-\\mathbf{w^w}[i]\\mathbf{e}[j]+\\mathbf{w^w}[i]\\mathbf{v}[j])$\n",
    "\n",
    "The units which determines this operations are the read and write Heads. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Differentiable Attention\n",
    "There are three possible forms of differentiable attention: this is more a fancy terminology to identify the three pricipal techniques involved in memory addressing. Before going into the details, we want to recall some of the techniques which are instead used in NTMs to appreciate the difference with DNCs. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two mechanism for addressing the memory and the Neural Tuning Machines combine them both:\n",
    "- *content-based addressing*: focuses attention on locations based on the similarity between their current values and values emitted by the controller. The controller needs to generate a value which is an approximation of the one stored and then retrieves the exact location. This is related to the content addressing of the Hopfield networks. \n",
    "- *location-based addressing*: it's the traditional approach used to address the memory. For arithmetic operations, where we need to define variables, the content-based technique in not enough and we need the locations of these variables to perform the operation required operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differentiable Neural Computers use a *content-based addressing* paired with other two techniques (TODO: quali?) which allow for a **Dynamic Memory Addressing** counteracting the major drawbacks of the NTM:\n",
    "1. NTMs cannot avoid possible overlapping and interference among blocks of allocated memory. DNCs, instead, overcame this problem due to there is only a single free at each write time.\n",
    "2. NTMs does not allow for freeing locations of memory which are not used. This can be a problem when processing long sequences. DNCs, instead, can free memory locations based on the usage weights.\n",
    "3. NTMs sequential information is preserved only if the content is written in consecutive locations. DNCs, instead, can use an additional temporal link matrix avoiding the restriction to continuous locations only. \n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have explained the concepts of these three differentiable attentions. A more detailed analysis will be given in the following paragraphs\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Content base addressing\n",
    "This form is used to determine the similarity measure between the vector emitted by the controller and the content of the memory. The measure is a *cosine similarity* function that returns the weights used by the read head for associative recall or by the write head to modify the content of the memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, if the key only matches a part of the content of the memory this is still useful and can lead to the retrieval of that location. This may be due to the fact the key has not all the information which instead are stored in the memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Temporary links\n",
    "This form keeps track of the transitions between locations which were consecutively written, using an $LxL$ temporal *link matrix* $L$. This matrix associates a weight from 0 to 1 to each pair of memory locations, where the entry $L[i,j]$ is the temporal relation between the locations $i$ and $j$. The weight is closer to $1$ if the locations $i$ was written after $j$, closer to $0$ otherwise. This gives to the Neural Network the ability to recover sequences following the order under which they were written.\n",
    "\n",
    "(TODO: questo pezzo non è chiaro)<br>\n",
    "The product $L\\mathbf{w}$ creates a smoothing effect, shifting the focus forward the locations after the ones emphasized by $\\mathbf{w}$. That is, after a writing which is based on $\\mathbf{w}$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Usage \n",
    "This form is used to allocate the memory for writing. The usage is a value between $0$ and $1$, with a weighting to select unused locations that is delivered to the writing head. The usage is incremented after each write to that location and decreased after each read. \n",
    "\n",
    "The good property is that this is independent from the memory size and content, allowing the network to be trained and then upgraded to a one with larger memory."

    "The code has been taken from [github](https://github.com/deepmind/dnc). The idea is to analyse it and further modify or add some Python code in order to achieve our goals. For now, we just list the major modules which are used to implement the DNC. Then, we will use the *Repeat Copy Task* to perform some tests on the DNC: the final goal from the implementation point of view is to extend the code implementing the *Graph Task*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modules provided are the following ones:\n",
    "- **Addressing and Access  Modules**, to implement the addressing methods discussed above. In addition, another script provides the function necessary to manipulate the memory exploiting the addressing methods already defined.\n",
    "- **DNC Module**, which represents the core of the Differentiable Neural Computer. This is an extention of the class *RNN core*, which includes also the memory manipulation. We have to remind that the Controller is implemented as an LSTM recurrent network.\n",
    "- **Repeat Copy Task**, used to create a dataset for the copy task. The DNC receives in input batches of collections of string which have to be copied a certain random number of times.\n",
    "- **Training Module**, the code for the trainig phase. It allows also to save model variables to checkpoint training progresses and restore the values for an input evaluation. Note that only the variables are saved and not the model itself: this means that it's needed to recreate the graph and load the variables during a session.\n",

(TODO: rivedere questa frase) That is, to deceive the DNC to perform its original task of copying a string of bits several times, we have changed the target: in this way, we force the DNC to assume it made it wrong, checking if for some samples this may cause a non convergence of the error to 0.\n",

    "## Graph Tasks - Explanation\n",
    "We propose now a Python code implementation for the **Graph Tasks** described in the paper. Before proceeding with the code, we provide some implementation design choices for the tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graph Tasks Description\n",
    "The idea is to perform the following tasks on a graph:\n",
    "- Traversal \n",
    "- Shortest Path\n",
    "- Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "All tasks need a random generation of graph triples consisting of a *source label*, *edge label* and *destination label*. To achieve so, we first generate a random graph by sampling the unit square *N* nodes. Then, *N* numbers are drawn uniformly between $0$ and $999$ and assigned randomly to the nodes. This makes the node labels to be unique across the nodes of the network. To decide the neighbors of each node, the KNN (K-nearest neighbour) is used. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the possible neighbors have been selected, edges between nodes are created. Each edge for the neigbourhood is given a label, which consists in a random number among the $N$ already selected for the nodes. For the **Traversal** and the **Shortest Path**, the *edge label* is unique in the neighborhood but not unique in the graph. This means that the DNC has to infer the possible unique relation between two given nodes and their relative edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encoding\n",
    "In order to provide those labels to the DNC controller, the triples are encoded using a **10-way one-hot encoding**. That is, each digit has been encoded using a $10$ bit vector with all zeros except the position which identifies the digit set to $1$. This is done for all the $9$ digit representing a triple creating a **90 bit** vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a **special reserved character** (\\_) which indicates that there is no input for the given label: this is represented with the zero vector, whose length is the same as if there were a digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phases\n",
    "For the training, the DNC controller receives sequences, each one representing a triple. The sequences are divided into four phases:\n",
    "1. **Description Phase**: used to present to the NN the triples of the graph over which perform the tasks.\n",
    "2. **Query Phase**: used to present queries to the NN based on the proposed graph.\n",
    "3. **Planning Phase**: no input are provided here, the phase is used to allow the DNC controller to prepare the answers.\n",
    "4. **Answer Phase**: apart for the *Shortest Path Task*, no input is presented here. During this phase, the DNC outputs the answers for the given queries. In this fase, and only here, also the targets are used to compute the loss and train the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to distinguish the different phases and indicate a transition, there are two additional bits (called channels) included in the input. The design choice is to let the bit of the first channel to be 1 only when there is a transition between the phases, and the bit of the second channel is set to $1$ only during the **Answer Phase**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output and Loss\n",
    "The output of the DNC controller is an array of 90 bits, representing nine softmax distribution over the 10 bits (digits). The loss for given sequences is computed as the sum of the log-probabilities of correctly predicting the bits for the nine digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "*TODO (sbatti): Here we have to comment about a possibile error in the paper where the sum is computed from 0 to 9. We have to argue due to this in not compliant with what is written before the formula.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Given input sequences $\\mathbf{x}$ and target $\\mathbf{z}$, the loss is computed as follow:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "    $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{z})=\\sum_{t=1}^T \\{ A(t) \\sum_{d=0}^8 log[Pr(\\mathbf{z_{t}^d}|\\mathbf{y_{t}^d}) ] \\} $\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>$\\mathbf{z_{t}^d}$ is the target for the sequence $t$ and for the digit $d$</li>\n",
    "    <li>$\\mathbf{y_{t}^d}$ is the DNC controller's output for the sequence $t$ and the digit $d$</li>\n",
    "    <li>$A(t)$ is a binary value which indicates when the loss has to be considered valid for the training. That is, ths value is $1$ during the **Answer Phase** and $0$ in the other ones. For the implementation, we have created a mask for simulating this scenario: the mask entry is set to 1 for those sequences for which the training is required.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Network Prediction** is determined as the mode of the output of the single softmax distribution over the 10 bits for each of the nine digits. When the network has finished to output an answer, a special output pattern is given as indicated in the paper. Our choise, as no further details are provided in the paper, is to output all (\\_) characters (which means a $90$ bit zero vector) as termination pattern. The DNC has been trained also on this special output. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, as a performances metric, the number of correct predictions over all the possibile ones is given."

    "## Graph Traversal Task\n",
    "The first task we implement is the Traversal one, based on random walks generated from a random Graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we have described before, during the **Description Phase** the graph triples are presented to the NN: then, we have a series of Queries and Answer triples. During the **Query Phase**, the first triple is made of the *source node* and *the edge* label (source label, edge label, \\_) with the destination missing. The further triples contain only the *edge label* (\\_, edge label, \\_). \n",
    "\n",
    "The DNC has to save the triples of the graph and infer the right nodes to recreate the random walks. We remind that the *edge labels* are not unique accross the graph: in other words, the network has to remember the previous destination node of a triple and use it as source label for the following triple."

    "The class is used to generate a dataset for the Traversal Task. The idea is to generate a 3D tensor of dimension (sequence_size, batch_size, input_size) as input of the DNC controller. In order to be compliant with the DNC definition provided in the GitHub repository, the tensor is a **time major** one which is used to allow faster computation in runtime. A time major tensor has the dimension of the sequences as first axis and the batch one as second axis. \n",
    "\n",
    "By default, 32 random walks are generated: in case of fewer random walks possible for the given graph, the maximum possible number is used to generate the walks. It's possible to ask for a single or multiple dataset to be created: in the last case, a list of dictionary has to be provided. For each dataset, the observations (comprising sequences for all the phases of the task) and targets are given. In addition, a mask matrix (sequence_size, batch_size) is provided to compute the loss as described above.\n",
